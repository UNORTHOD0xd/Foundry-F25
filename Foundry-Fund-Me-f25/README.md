# 🚀 Foundry-F25: My Cyfrin Updraft Journey

Welcome to my personal repository documenting my progression through the [Cyfrin Updraft](https://updraft.cyfrin.io/) Foundry course. This journey has been instrumental in enhancing my skills in smart contract development using Solidity and the Foundry framework.

## 📚 Course Overview

The Cyfrin Updraft Foundry course is designed to take developers from intermediate to advanced levels in smart contract development. Throughout the course, I engaged with various projects that deepened my understanding of blockchain concepts and development practices.

## 🛠️ Projects Completed

### 1. Foundry Simple Storage

- **Objective**: Learn the basics of smart contract development with Foundry.
- **Skills Acquired**:
  - Writing and compiling Solidity contracts.
  - Deploying contracts locally using Anvil.
  - Interacting with contracts via the command line.
  - Implementing unit tests to ensure contract functionality.

### 2. Foundry Fund Me

- **Objective**: Develop a decentralized crowdfunding platform.
- **Skills Acquired**:
  - Handling ETH transfers and managing user contributions.
  - Integrating Chainlink price feeds for real-time ETH/USD conversions.
  - Writing comprehensive tests using Foundry's testing framework.
  - Optimizing gas usage within smart contracts.
  - Verifying contracts on Etherscan for transparency.



## 🧰 Tools & Technologies Used

- **Foundry**: A blazing-fast, portable, and modular toolkit for Ethereum application development.
- **Solidity**: The primary programming language for writing smart contracts.
- **Anvil**: A local Ethereum node for testing and development.
- **Ethers.js**: A JavaScript library for interacting with the Ethereum blockchain.
- **Chainlink**: Decentralized oracle networks providing external data to smart contracts.

## 📈 Skills Developed
